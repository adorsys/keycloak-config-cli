# Full managed resources

keycloak-config-cli manage some types of resources absolutely. For example if a `group` isn't defined
inside the import json but other `groups` specified, keycloak-config-cli will calculate the
difference and delete the `group` from keycloak.

In some cases it is required to include some keycloak defaults because keycloak-config-cli can't
detect if the entity comes from a user or auto created by keycloak itself.

There are 2 modes to ensure a specific behavior:

### 1. Keycloak should not manage type of resources:

For example if you don't define any `groups` inside the import json, keycloak does not touch any `groups`.

### 2. Keycloak manage type of resources:

For example define any `groups` you want inside the import json, keycloak ensure that the groups are available but other
groups will be deleted. If you define `groups` but set an empty array, keycloak will delete all groups in keycloak.

## Disable deletion of managed entities

If you don't delete properties of a specific type, you can disable this behavior by default a properties like `import.managed.<entity>=<full|no-delete>`, e.g.:
`import.managed.required-actions=no-delete`

## State management

If `import.state` is set to `true` (default value), keycloak-config-cli will purge only resources they created before by keycloak-config-cli. If `import.state` is set to `false`, keycloak-config-cli will purge all existing entities if they are not defined in import json.

### Supported resources

Following entities does have saved state:

- Required Actions
- Components
