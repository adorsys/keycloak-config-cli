# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [3.1.0] - 2021-02-18

### Added

- `wget` inside docker container
- If `keycloak.grant-type` is set to `client_credentials` the tool can use client_id and client_secret for obtaining its OAuth tokens (
  default: `password`)
- The `keycloak.client-secret` can now be set for confidential OAuth clients (and it's required for the `client_credentials` flow together with
  an `keycloak.client-id` referring an OAuth client which supports the client_credentials OAuth flow).
- import.path accepts now zip files and remote locations (http)

### Changed

- Default development branch renamed from `master` to `main`
- The docker tag `master` has been renamed to `edge`
- Bump keycloak from 12.0.2 to 12.0.3

### Fixed

- Cleanup old authenticator configs
- Ordering and execution flow authentication config if multiple execution have the same authenticator.

## [3.0.0] - 2021-01-20

### Breaking

- keycloak-config-cli does not auto append `/auth/` to the keycloak path.
- Role and Clients are `fully manged` now. See: [docs/MANAGED.md](docs/MANAGED.md). *Take care while upgrade exist keycloak instances*. This upgrade
  should be tested carefully on existing instances. If `import.state` is enabled, only roles and clients created by keycloak-config-cli will be
  deleted. Set `--import.managed.role=no-delete` and `--import.managed.client=no-delete` will restore the keycloak-config-cli v2.x behavior.

### Added

- Support for Keycloak 12.0.1
